.SH NAME

decomposer-install - Install all the libraries
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
decomposer install [--no-dev]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Install all the libraries defined in the \fIdecomposer.json\fR file and generates
the include file.
.P
The include file contains a check that returns an error in case it is outdated.
This extra check is mainly useful on a development environment to get warned to
rerun \fIdecomposer\fR after the project's last pull of changes updated the
\fIdecomposer.json\fR file. It should not be necessary on a controlled production
environment. Not having it there is saving some unnecessary computing for every
process. On such a production environment, the \fB--no-dev\fR option should be then
used.
.P
As a precaution to not wreak havoc on your development setup, \fIdecomposer\fR will
not touch libraries in \fIDECOMPOSER_TARGET_DIR\fR that are manually installed using symbolic
links or git worktree checkouts. However, do note that in case it is a normal
git clone, \fIdecomposer\fR will reset the repo and throw away any local changes.
