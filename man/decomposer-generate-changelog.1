Generate a changelog of the main project and its libraries.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB-f --file\fR \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Define the file to write the changelog to.

Default is a \fIdecomposer.diffnotes.md\fR file in the current working directory
.P
.RE
\fB-t --time\fR \fItime\fR
.RS 4
Define the base in the local history to generate the changes against.
.br
Default is "5 minutes ago"
.P
So for example using "\fB-t\fR '1 hour ago'" would generate a file containing the
changes from the version that was installed locally 1 hour ago
(see \fBgitrevisions\fR(1) for allowed \fItime\fR values. The default is to generate
a changelog against the version from "5 minutes ago". This means that if the
command is run just after an install command, it will report all the changes
brought up by that last installation.
.P
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.P
\fIDECOMPOSER_TARGET_DIR\fR
